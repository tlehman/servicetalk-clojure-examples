# servicetalk-clojure-examples

[ServiceTalk](https://github.com/apple/servicetalk) is an open source Java networking framework made by Apple. It supports HTTP/2 and is built on top of Netty, which uses non-heap memory objects like [ByteBuf](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/buffer/ByteBuf.html).

This project shows how to use ServiceTalk inside a Clojure program.
